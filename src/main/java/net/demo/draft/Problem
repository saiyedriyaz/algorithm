You have a number of boxes N with widths and heights given as a pair of integers (width, height). 
One box can fit into another only if both the width and height of one box is greater than the width and height of the other box.
What is the maximum number of boxes you put inside other? Whats the time complexity?
-----------------------
You want to place a new bank ATM machine on an empty area which reaches all near banks and ATM machines in the shortest amount of distance.
You can only search up, down, left and right for an empty area. Given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

    Each 0 marks an empty area which you can use freely.
    Each 1 marks a bank which you cannot pass through.
    Each 2 marks an ATM which you cannot pass through.
    
For example, given three banks at (0,0), (1,4), (2,1), and an ATM at (0,3).
The point (1,1) is an ideal empty area to place your ATM, as the total driving distance of 6 is minimal.
So as a result to return is 6.
As only input consider 2D array with 0, 1 or 2 marks only.
